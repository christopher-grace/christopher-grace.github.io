- Analyzed and visualized individual and aggregated customer consumption data to identify grid inefficiencies such as charging electric vehicles during periods of peak demand.
- Data was extracted from individual files and loaded into a Pandas DataFrame.  Statistics for three criteria were collected to determine how likely each residence had an electric vehicle.
- Goal of identifying and changing behavior through the use of future power company incentives.
- Machine Learning Addendum: Exploring classifying meters through grouping with K-means Clustering and K-nearest Neighbor Classification.

- Leveraged Redfin and Foursquare APIs to create a method of recommending homes which fit both client house and neighborhood amenity criteria.
- Project returns a list of suitable homes as well as a Folium map of each suitable neighborhood with nearest required amenities shown.

- Assessed if wind direction and velocity caused a correlated shift to predicted tide levels in Wells, ME using Pandas and Jupyter Notebook.
- Extracted data using API and by segmenting requests to avoid limitations.
- Plotted data with Seaborn and Matplotlib.
- Determined east-northeast and east wind directions have a positive correlation with respect to predicted height.  A 20 mph sustained wind from the ENE or E will cause about a 2 ft increase in sea level.
